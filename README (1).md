# 📈 Stock Market Prediction using Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Stock Market Prediction** project! This repository showcases a beginner-friendly approach to using historical stock data and machine learning for price prediction. Whether you're a data scientist, finance enthusiast, or just someone who enjoys decoding market trends, this notebook has something valuable for you.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This notebook covers:
- 📥 **Data Collection** using the `yfinance` API
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** for reliable predictions
- 📊 **Feature Engineering** including technical indicators like:
  - Simple Moving Average (SMA)
  - Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
  - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
- 📉 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with beautiful visualizations
- 🤖 **Model Building** using Linear Regression to predict stock prices
- 📏 **Model Evaluation** using metrics like MSE (Mean Squared Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- 🧪 **Prediction & Result Analysis** with interpretation

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning
- yfinance for stock data extraction

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

Clone the repo and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock_market_prediction.git
cd stock_market_prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, install required libraries manually:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn yfinance
```

### Run the Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook stock_market_prediction.ipynb
```

## 📊 Visual Insights

You’ll find insightful plots including:
- Candlestick trends
- SMA & EMA overlays
- RSI analysis for overbought/oversold zones
- MACD crossovers and signal lines

## 📌 To-Do

- [ ] Add support for multiple ML models (e.g., Random Forest, LSTM)
- [ ] Include hyperparameter tuning
- [ ] Improve prediction granularity (daily/hourly)
- [ ] Build a web-based dashboard (Streamlit / Dash)
- [ ] Integrate sentiment analysis from financial news
